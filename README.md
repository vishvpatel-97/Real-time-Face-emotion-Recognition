### Dataset Link

Create folder : Dataset
In Dataset folder create 2 folders : train and test Put training images in train folder and validation images in test folder.
Download dataset from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/msambare/fer2013

### Project Brief:

- First step is to preprocess the images and to convert them into required format.
- I have used MobileNetV2 architecture for traning the model because of its light weight.
- Used **"haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml** file for detecting and cropping of the faces. 
- Using **OpenCV, tensorflow-Keras API & Transfer learning**, code is made for real time face emotion recognition.
